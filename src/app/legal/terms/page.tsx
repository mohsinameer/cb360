            <h2>Payment or Subscriptions</h2>
            <h4>Billing</h4>
            <p>
              You will provide us with accurate and complete billing information
              including full name, address, state, zip code, country, telephone
              number, company details (if applicable) and valid payment method
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the automatic billing fails to occur for any reason, we will
              issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
              manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
              corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
            </p>
            <h4>Payment or Subscription period</h4>
            <p>
              If you choose a subscription, you will be billed in advance on a
              recurring and periodic basis (monthly or annually), depending on
              the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing the
              subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you choose a one-time charge (&apos;once&apos;), CB360 and
              it&apos;s services are available to you for the lifetime of the
              product, as is during purchase. Updates are complimentary.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each period, your subscription will automatically
              renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we
              cancel it before the next billing period starts.
            </p>
            <h4>Subscription cancellations</h4>
            <p>
              If you chose a subscription, you may cancel your subscription
              renewal either through your account settings page or by contacting
              us (support@CB360.com). You will not receive a refund for the fees
              you already paid for your current subscription period and you will
              be able to use CB360 until the end of your current subscription
              period.
            </p>
            <h4>Refunds</h4>
            <p>
              Except when required by law, paid subscription fees are
              non-refundable.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we will consider certain refund requests for
              subscriptions on a case-by-case basis and granted at our sole
              discretion. In any case, we consider refunds only within the first
              14 days after purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payment provider fees that are non-refundable to us, will be
              deducted from your refund (solely as an indication, this is
              typically 2-3%).
            </p>
